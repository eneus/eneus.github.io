      <description>In this Article I had collected all available OS for single-board computer ASUS Tinker Board. Based on this computer i will to construct my robot with AI implementation and computer vision. Actually this the first reason why i had select Tinker Board that based on Rockchip RK3288 processor with 4x Cores &amp;ldquo;Cortex-A17&amp;rdquo; and work with frequency 1.8 GHz, and support hardware decoding H.265 with resolution 4K х 2К and besides, new chipset get support network 4G LTE with 64-bit RAM LPDDR3.</description>

      <description>This article assumes you have a minimum understanding vectors, and matrices. I will simply show applications of vectors and matrices and how they apply to game programming.
In this article, I would like to provide a brief math primer for people who would like to get involved in game programming. This is not an exhaustive explanation of all the math theory that one will have to know in order to be a successful game programmer, but it’s the very minimum amount of information that is necessary to know before you can begin as a game programmer.</description>
